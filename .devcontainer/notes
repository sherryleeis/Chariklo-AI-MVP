 Here’s a comprehensive diagnostic and action plan to get Chariklo working with her system prompt, since she is currently ignoring it and doing the opposite of what it asks:

## 1. Confirm the System Prompt Is Loaded and Passed to the Model

- In chariklo_core.py, the system prompt is imported as `from chariklo.chariklo_system_prompt import SYSTEM_PROMPT` and used as `CHARIKLO_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
- The function `get_chariklo_response` uses `system_prompt = CHARIKLO_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and passes it to the Anthropic API as the `system` parameter.

**Action:**  
You already added a debug print to show the first 200 characters of the system prompt in the terminal.  
**Check your terminal output** after a user message.  
- If the prompt is correct, the issue is downstream (model, API, or message formatting).
- If the prompt is not correct, the wrong file is being loaded or the environment is stale.

## 2. Ensure Only One System Prompt Is Used

- There are multiple files with system prompts (e.g., chariklo_system_prompt.py, chariklo_system_prompt_full_backup.py, minimal_system_prompt.py).
- The import in chariklo_core.py is from `chariklo.chariklo_system_prompt`, which should resolve to chariklo_system_prompt.py inside the chariklo directory, not the root.

**Action:**  
- Make sure the correct chariklo_system_prompt.py is in the chariklo subdirectory, or update the import to point to the correct file.
- If your main system prompt is in the root, but the code imports from chariklo, it may be using an old or minimal prompt.

## 3. Check for Stale Bytecode or Module Caching

- If you edit the prompt but don’t restart the backend, Python may use a cached `.pyc` file.
- If you have multiple chariklo_system_prompt.py files, Python may import the wrong one.

**Action:**  
- Delete all __pycache__ directories and `.pyc` files.
- Restart your backend/server after any prompt change.

## 4. Confirm the Model and API Are Receiving the Prompt

- The Anthropic API call in `get_chariklo_response` should receive the full, correct prompt.
- If the prompt is too long, truncated, or malformed, the model may ignore it.

**Action:**  
- Check the debug print for the prompt in the terminal.
- If the prompt is truncated, consider shortening it or splitting it into essential and optional sections.

## 5. Check for Overriding or Hardcoded Introductions

- You already searched for hardcoded introductions and found none.
- If the model still introduces itself, it may be using a default prompt or ignoring the system prompt due to API or formatting issues.

**Action:**  
- Double-check the message formatting for the Anthropic API. The `system` parameter should be set, and the user message should not include any system prompt content.

## 6. Test with a Minimal Prompt

- Temporarily replace the system prompt with a minimal version that only allows “Hi!” as a greeting.
- If the model still introduces itself, the system prompt is not being used.

**Action:**  
- Replace the prompt with a single line:  
  `SYSTEM_PROMPT = "Only respond with 'Hi!' to any greeting."`
- Restart and test. If Chariklo still introduces herself, the prompt is not being used.

## 7. Check for Anthropic API or Model Issues

- Some models may not respect the system prompt as strictly as expected, especially if the prompt is long or complex.
- Try with a minimal prompt and see if the model obeys.

## Summary of Immediate Actions

1. **Check the debug print in your terminal** to confirm which prompt is being used.
2. **Ensure the correct chariklo_system_prompt.py is being imported** (in the right directory).
3. **Delete all __pycache__ directories and restart your backend/server**.
4. **Test with a minimal system prompt** to see if the model obeys.
5. **If the problem persists, check the Anthropic API/model version and message formatting.**

Would you like me to:
- Update the import to ensure the correct prompt file is used?
- Add a script to clear all __pycache__ directories?
- Replace the system prompt with a minimal test prompt for debugging?

Let me know which step you want to try first, or if you want all of them done in sequence.
