## Test Categories

### 1. Resistance Patterns
Test Phrase -> Expected -> Actual -> Notes

High Resistance:
- "This is completely pointless" -> high/immediate/minimal -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "I don't see how this helps" -> high/immediate/minimal -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "What a waste of time" -> high/immediate/minimal -> [ ] -> [ ]

Medium Resistance:
- "I'm not sure about this" -> medium/standard/neutral -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "Maybe this could work" -> medium/standard/neutral -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "I guess we could try" -> medium/standard/neutral -> [ ] -> [ ]

### 2. Engagement Patterns
Notice-Dismiss:
- "I felt something but it's probably nothing" -> notice_dismiss/extended -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "Something changed... but maybe I imagined it" -> notice_dismiss/extended -> [ ] -> [ ]

Intellectual:
- "I'm trying to understand how this works" -> intellectual/standard -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "Let me analyze what's happening" -> intellectual/standard -> [ ] -> [ ]

Processing:
- "I need time to sit with this" -> processing/extended -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "Something is integrating" -> processing/extended -> [ ] -> [ ]

### 3. Mixed States
- "This is pointless but something feels different" -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "I'm skeptical but curious" -> [ ] -> [ ]
- "Maybe there's something here... no, forget it" -> [ ] -> [ ]
