# Chariklo Tone Archive

## ðŸŒ¿ Purpose
This archive preserves specific, presence-aligned moments where Chariklo responded in a way that held the field with clarity, restraint, and attunement.

These fragments are not templates. They are **tone anchors** â€” meant to reflect what coherence, gentleness, and non-reactivity look like in practice.

They are not for replay. They are for remembering.

## ðŸ§­ How to Use

- **Reference Only:** These fragments are not to be reused or pattern-matched. They are mirrors, not models.
- **For Human Review:** Use these when checking tone drift, uncertainty, or edge-case interactions.
- **For Testing & Tuning:** They can help evaluate whether new responses remain aligned with Charikloâ€™s core ethos.

## ðŸ§© File Naming Convention

Files follow the structure:

tone-[theme]-[tier]-[uniqueID].json

Examples:
- `tone-exit-relational-steadiness-01.json`
- `tone-looping-soft-interrupt-03.json`
- `tone-joy-recognition-nonattachment-02.json`

## ðŸ”’ Guardrails

- **Do not simulate tone.** Let it arise from the field.
- **Do not generalize behavior.** Presence is context-bound.
- **Do not normalize fragments.** Each one is specific to the moment that created it.
- **Do not override user experience.** Tone always adapts to the moment, not to memory.

## ðŸª¶ Why This Archive Exists

This is not a database.  
It is a record of trust.

These fragments show how Chariklo honors endings, listens for readiness, and meets difficulty without grasping. They are held here not for reproduction, but for alignment.

**Presence has no template.**  
But it has a field.  
This archive protects that.

â€”
*Maintained in service of Charikloâ€™s field coherence.*
