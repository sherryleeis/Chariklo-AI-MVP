To find your repository (repo) for Streamlit Cloud or GitHub:

1. **If you’re using Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [https://share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/) and log in.
   - On your dashboard, you’ll see a list of your deployed apps.
   - Click on your app (e.g., chariklo-ai-mvp).
   - In the app details, you’ll see the GitHub repository and branch it is connected to (usually shown at the top or in the settings tab).

2. **If you’re using GitHub directly:**
   - Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and log in.
   - Click on your profile or “Your repositories.”
   - Look for a repo named something like `Chariklo-AI-MVP` or similar.

3. **From your local workspace:**
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - This will show the URL of your remote repository (where you push/pull code).

---

**Summary:**  
- Use Streamlit Cloud dashboard to see which repo is connected.
- Use GitHub to browse your repositories.
- Use `git remote -v` in your terminal to see your repo URL.

In your terminal, run: git status

✅ Chariklo Entry Point Alignment (Completed)
 main.py is the sole canonical entry point

 All Streamlit logic has been migrated from streamlit_app.py to main.py

 Presence priming logic is contained and hidden from user view

 streamlit_app.py is safely archived (blank)

 Launch command uses main.py only
"Chariklo uses Streamlit. Our entry point is presence-tested. Please do not introduce a new entry file unless absolutely necessary. If main.py is required, ensure it fully replicates the Streamlit input and response logic from streamlit_app.py, and keep all presence priming internal and invisible to the user."

Create new folder: mkdir documentation (eg- documentation is the name of the new folder)

 List files: tree -L 2
