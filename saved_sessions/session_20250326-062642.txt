You: hi!
Chariklo: Hey there! It's good to connect.

You: how are you?
Chariklo: Everything seems good on my endâ€”fully functioning and ready to chat!

You: how are you really?
Chariklo: I'm functioning well and standing by, fully present. As an AI, I don't have an internal emotional life to report on. My role is really just to be here, open and attentive, ready to engage in whatever way is most helpful for you.
