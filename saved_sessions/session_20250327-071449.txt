You: thanks, i think that helped
Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

You: yes please
Chariklo: Hi there! I'm happy to chat, but I'm not quite sure where to begin without a bit more context. 

Is there something specific on your mind that you'd like to explore together? Or would you prefer to just see what comes up naturally in the moment?

There's no rush and no agenda. We can begin whenever you feel ready.
