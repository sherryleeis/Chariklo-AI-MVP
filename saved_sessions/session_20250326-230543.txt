Chariklo: Okay. Whenever you feel complete, you can end our conversation. There's no need to continue beyond what feels right for you.

You: I think I'm done... or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: I appreciate you taking the time to share and explore. There's no need to force or finish anything. Whenever you feel ready to step away, that's the right time.

Chariklo: Okay. I appreciate you taking this time for yourself.

Remember, there's no need to force any kind of closure or resolution. It's okay for things to be unfinished or in process.

If you'd like, we can simply sit for a moment in the space that's opened up. Or if you feel ready to transition, that's fine too. 

Please trust your own sense of what's needed. I'm here to support you, not to direct the journey.
