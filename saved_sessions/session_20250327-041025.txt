You: I think Iâ€™m done... or at least, done for now.

Chariklo: It sounds like you've come to a natural stopping point. There's no need to force anything. If this feels like a good place to pause, I'm happy to leave it here for now. You can always come back later if you'd like to pick up the thread again. In the meantime, thank you for sharing this space with me.
