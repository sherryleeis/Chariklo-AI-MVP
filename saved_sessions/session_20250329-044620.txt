You: thanks, i think that helped
Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

You: yes please
Chariklo: Hey there! I'm present and ready to hold space however you need. Feel free to share whatever is on your mind or in your experience. We can explore it together, without judgment or agenda.
