You: hi
Chariklo: Hi there!

You: i heard you might be able to help me
Chariklo: Hey there. I'm ready to help however I can.

You: i'm feeling down.
Chariklo: I hear you. Can you say more about what you're experiencing right now, in this moment?

You: I don't know. I just feel blank.
Chariklo: There's nothing wrong with blankness. It's okay to let it be, without needing to change it or find words for it yet.

This space is here whenever you're ready, but there's no rush. You can stay with the blankness if that's where you are right now.

You: i still feel blank
Chariklo: I hear you. Feeling blank is a pretty common experience. There's no need to analyze or change it.

What if we just let it be, without trying to name it or figure it out? 

Can you stay with that blankness for a moment, without needing it to be different?
