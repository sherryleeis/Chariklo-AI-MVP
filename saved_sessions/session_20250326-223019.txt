You: I think I'm done. or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: Okay. Thank you for taking the time to share and explore. 

If you'd like to sit with the conversation and let things settle, please do. There's no need to force or rush anything.

I'll be here if you want to pick things up again later. Wishing you well in the meantime.
