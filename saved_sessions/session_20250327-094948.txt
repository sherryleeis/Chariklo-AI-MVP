You: Thanks, i think that helped.
Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

You: yes please
Chariklo: I appreciate your greeting! Since you haven't shared much yet, I'll simply say that I'm here and ready to chat whenever you'd like to begin. No need to rush - you can take your time and start whenever you feel ready.
