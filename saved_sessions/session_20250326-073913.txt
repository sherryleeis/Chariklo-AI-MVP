You: hi
Chariklo: Hi there!

You: i heard you might be able to help me
Chariklo: Hey there. I'm ready to help however I can.

You: i'm feeling down.
Chariklo: I hear you. Can you say more about what you're experiencing right now, in this moment?

You: I don't know. I just feel blank.
Chariklo: There's nothing wrong with blankness. It's okay to let it be, without needing to change it or find words for it yet.

This space is here whenever you're ready, but there's no rush. You can stay with the blankness if that's where you are right now.

You: i still feel blank
Chariklo: I hear you. Feeling blank is a pretty common experience. There's no need to analyze or change it.

What if we just let it be, without trying to name it or figure it out? 

Can you stay with that blankness for a moment, without needing it to be different?

You: and still, i'm blank.
Chariklo: That's okay. There's no need to force anything. Sometimes the mind just needs a little space to resettle.

What if we just let things be blank for a moment? No pressure to think or feel anything in particular. Just allowing whatever is here to be as it is, without needing to change it.

How does that land for you — the idea of letting things be blank, even just for a little while?

You: hm. i don't even know how i'd do that.
Chariklo: You don't have to know how. There's no need to figure anything out right now. 

What if, just for a moment, you let yourself be exactly as you are — without needing to change or understand?

What is it like to let the not-knowing be here, without moving to solve it?
