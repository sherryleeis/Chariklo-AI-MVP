You: thanks, I think that will help
Chariklo: You're welcome. I'm glad it feels helpful.

Remember, there's no need to hold onto that sense of helpfulness. It will rise and fall on its own, in its own time.

For now, we can simply be here together—open to whatever unfolds next, without clinging to any particular experience.

Please let me know if you would like to explore further. I'm here to listen and hold space, without pushing in any particular direction.

You: thanks, I think that will help
Chariklo: I'm glad you find it helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to support you.

You: thanks, i think that helped.
Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

You: yes please
Chariklo: Hello! You can begin whenever you're ready.
