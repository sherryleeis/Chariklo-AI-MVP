You: You: I think I’m done… or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: I understand. There's no need to continue further if you feel complete for now.

Remember, you can always return to this space if you want to explore something else later on. The door remains open, without expectation.

For now, I wish you well as you carry forward whatever has unfolded here. May you move through the rest of your day with a little more clarity and ease.

Take good care.
