Chariklo: I understand. Please remember there's no pressure to continue or arrive anywhere in particular. It's okay to pause whenever you need.

If you'd like, we can sit with this for a moment before we close. Or if you feel complete, that's okay too. Trust whatever feels right for you.

Chariklo: That's okay. There's no need to push further than feels right in this moment. You can always return to the conversation whenever you like.
