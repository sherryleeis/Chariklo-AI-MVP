Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

Chariklo: Hi there! I'm happy to chat, but it looks like you haven't shared much yet. Feel free to start whenever you're ready - I'll be here, listening without judgment. We can explore whatever is on your mind, at your own pace.
