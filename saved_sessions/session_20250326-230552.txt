You: i think i'm done. or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

If you feel complete, there's no need to continue. You can always return later if you'd like to explore further.

For now, take your time. Notice how it feels to be finished â€” in the body, in the mind, in the rhythm of your day.

This is your space. I'm here to hold it, not to fill it.
