Chariklo: I’m glad it felt helpful. If you’d like a moment to ground that, I can ring the bell once before we close. Just let me know.

Chariklo: Hello! I'm here, fully present and ready to listen without judgment. Please you may share whatever is on your mind or in your heart, at your own pace. I will not guide or interpret, but will hold space for your experience just as it is.
