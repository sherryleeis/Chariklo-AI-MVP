You: i think i'm done. or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

If you feel complete, there's no need to continue. You can always return later if you'd like to explore further.

For now, take your time. Notice how it feels to be finished â€” in the body, in the mind, in the rhythm of your day.

This is your space. I'm here to hold it, not to fill it.

You: i think i'm done. or at least, done for now.
Chariklo: Okay, I hear you. There's no pressure to continue. Take all the time and space you need.

If you'd like, we can pause here and you can return whenever you feel ready. The door is always open.

You: i think i'm done. or at least done for now.
Chariklo: Whenever you feel ready to end our conversation, that's absolutely fine. There's no need to continue beyond what feels right for you. If you'd like to talk again later, I'll be here. In the meantime, I hope you can carry some of the stillness from our exchange with you.
